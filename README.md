# Machine-Learning


## Getting started with machine learning

Before starting with this curriculum, you need to have your computer set up and ready to run notebooks locally.

- **Configure your machine with these videos**. Use the following links to learn [how to install Python](https://youtu.be/CXZYvNRIAKM) in your system and [setup a text editor](https://youtu.be/EU8eayHWoZg) for development.
- **Learn Python**. It's also recommended to have a basic understanding of [Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/python-language/?WT.mc_id=academic-77952-leestott), a programming language useful for data scientists that we use in this course.
- **Create a GitHub account**. Since you found us here on [GitHub](https://github.com), you might already have an account, but if not, create one and then fork this curriculum to use on your own. (Feel free to give us a star, too ðŸ˜Š)
- **Explore Scikit-learn**. Familiarize yourself with [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html), a set of ML libraries that we reference in these lessons.

## What is machine learning?

The term 'machine learning' is one of the most popular and frequently used terms of today. There is a nontrivial possibility that you have heard this term at least once if you have some sort of familiarity with technology, no matter what domain you work in. The mechanics of machine learning, however, are a mystery to most people. For a machine learning beginner, the subject can sometimes feel overwhelming. Therefore, it is important to understand what machine learning actually is, and to learn about it step by step, through practical examples.

## Why study machine learning?

Machine learning, from a systems perspective, is defined as the creation of automated systems that can learn hidden patterns from data to aid in making intelligent decisions.

This motivation is loosely inspired by how the human brain learns certain things based on the data it perceives from the outside world.
